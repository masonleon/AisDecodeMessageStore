 * - UNSUPPORTED: the transaction we wanted to write was not committed because the message is unsupported for whatever
 * arbitrary reason. As such, a different transaction was successfully written. e.g we tried to write to vesselData, but
 * there was no actual vessel data in the AIS Message, so NULLs were written instead.
